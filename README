NAME
    Artemis::Reports::DPath - Extended DPath access to Artemis reports.

SYNOPSIS
        use Artemis::Reports::DPath 'reports_dpath_search';
        # the first bogomips entry of math sections:
        @resultlist = reportdata (
                         '{ suite_name => "TestSuite-LmBench" } :: /tap/section/math/*/bogomips[0]'
                      );
        # all report IDs of suite_id 17 that FAILed:
        @resultlist = reportdata (
                         '{ suite_name => "TestSuite-LmBench" } :: /suite_id[value == 17]/../successgrade[value eq 'FAIL']/../id'
                      );

    This searches all reports of the test suite "TestSuite-LmBench" and
    furthermore in them for a TAP section "math" with the particular subtest
    "bogomips" and takes the first array entry of them.

    The part before the '::' selects reports to search in a DBIx::Class
    search query, the second part is a normal Data::DPath expression that
    matches against the datastructure that is build from the DB.

METHODS and FUNCTIONS

    Takes an extended DPath expression, applies it to an Artemis Reports
